## Project Background 
This project analyzes City General Hospital’s data to tackle challenges like ER overcrowding, staff burnout, and medication errors. An interactive Excel dashboard highlights insights and offers practical solutions to improve hospital operations.

--- 
 
## Project Objective 
-	Identify trends in admissions by day to improve staff scheduling.
-	Review medication uses and lab results to reduce waste and improve accuracy.
-	Assess billing and insurance to find underpayments.
-	Analyze patient demographics to align resources with actual needs.
-	Evaluate doctor workload and suggest ways to balance patient assignments.

--- 
 
## Datasets 

**Patients.csv / Patients.xlsx** - patient ID, age, gender, blood type, medical condition, date of admission, doctor, hospital, insurance provider, billing amount, room number, admission type, discharge date, medication, test results, hospital latitude, hospital longitude

--- 
## Dashboard Features 
-	Key KPIs: total patients, average waiting, total doctors  
-	Visuals include doughnut, column, bar, and clustered column charts to represent admissions trends, medication usage, insurance payments, and test results
-	Interactivity: slicers for Age group, Day of the week , Medication type 
 
--- 
## Key Findings
- Most patients are 50–59-year-old females
- Highest admissions occur on Thursdays, highlighting peak demand days.
- Aetna Insurance shows lower payment amounts compared to other providers,while Cigna has the highest billing payments. Medicare covers the largest number of patients, whereas Cigna has the fewest
- Top 10 doctors handle the majority of patients, while some doctors have significantly fewer cases.
- Lipitor is used most frequently and should be prioritized for restocking.
- Emergency cases spike on Tuesdays, requiring staff and resource planning.
- Out of 55,500 tests, 19,425 are inconclusive, indicating potential issues with lab processes or equipment.( Approximately 35% of tests are inconclusive)

## Recommendations 
1.	Increase staff availability on Thursdays to manage peak admissions and also allocate more resources on Tuesdays for emergency cases.
2.	Prioritize Lipitor for restocking due to high usage.
3.	Develop targeted care programs for 50–59-year-old female patients, the largest demographic group.
4.	Investigate why Aetna Insurance payments are lower and assess potential adjustments or follow-ups to maximize reimbursements. 
5.	Consider redistributing patients or providing additional support to prevent burnout and maintain quality of care.
6.	Train lab staff on proper testing procedures to reduce inconclusive results
